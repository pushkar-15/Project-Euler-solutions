# By solving, we get:
# Answer is the smallest k which satisfies 	10^k â‰£ 1 (mod d)
# (this is called the multiplicative order of 10 in the field of d)
# We search only for primes because non-prime numbers tend to have shorter repeating cycles because their reciprocals reduce to simpler fractions.
